Curie received a general education in local schools and some scientific training from her father At the time, Warsaw was controlled by Russia and her parents both were in support of Polish nationalism, which caused the family much hardship. Maria and her sister became involved in the secret Flying University, a Polish patriotic institution that admitted women. Her sister later invited Maria to join her in Paris to study, but she could not afford tuition. She spent a year and a half working to raise the funds and in that time she continued to educate herself. After saving tuition money, Maria left for France in 1891 to pursue more scientific education. A young Maria before she left for Paris</SMPL>

In France she became known as Marie. In late 1891 she enrolled in the University of Paris to study physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Received a degree in Physics in 1893 In 1894, she earned a second degree in Mathematics Depended on tutoring and teaching to earn a living while she began investigating the magnetic properties of various steels Marie returned to Warsaw in the summer of 1894 to visit her family. She hoped to continue her studies in Poland, but was denied a position at Kraków University because she was a woman. A man she met at the University of Paris named Pierre Curie convinced Marie to return to Paris for her PhD. Marie and Pierre were later married on July 26, 1895. They were constant companions in life and in their scientific studies.</SMPL>

In 1896, Herni Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays. Thus, Curie began to research rays emitted by uranium. Techniques to investigate samples: Using an electrometer (a device for measuring electric charge created by her husband 15 years prior), Curie found that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. She hypothesized that radiation was not the outcome of interactions of molecules, but that it came from the atoms. An integral step in disproving the assumption that atoms are indivisible. The Curie’s did not have a lab and instead researched in a shed, which was not ventilated and not waterproof. Photos of the Curie’s lab</SMPL>

Thus, Curie researched for other radiation emitting substances By 1898, Curie discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive.</SMPL>

Polonium is related to bismuth and polonium was the only bismuth like substance in a pitchblende ore, thus polonium was easily found. However, Curie never succeeded in isolating polonium (likely due to a half-life of only 138 days). Radium, related to barium, was more difficult to isolate as pitchblende contains both radium and barium. The Curies separated out radium salt by differential crystallization. From one ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was found in 1902. By 1910, Curie isolated pure radium metal.

With the help of her 17 year old daughter Irène and a military doctor, Curie installed mobile radiological vehicles and radiological units at field hospitals In 1915, Curie made hollow needles containing radon to used for sterilizing tissue. After the war started, Curie attempted to donate her gold Nobel Prize medals to the war effort, but the French National Bank would not accept them. Marie driving a mobile X-ray truck during WWI.

President Harding received her at the White House and presented Curie with 1 gram of radium collected in the USA. At this time, the French government were embarrassed that Curie has no French official distinctions to wear in public. The French government offered her the Legion of Honour award, but she refused. In 1922, Curie joined the French Academy of Medicine and became a member of the International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations. Led by Curie, the Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners. Two of which were her daughter Irène and her son-in-law. In 1930, Curie was elected to the International Atomic Weights Committee where she served until her death. Marie pictured with her children (left) and with her husband Pierre (right)</SMPL>

The cause of the aplastic anemia was due to prolonged exposure to radioactivity. Curie often carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pockets and stored them in desk drawers. She was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during WWI. Decades of these exposure left Curie in states of chronic illness, yet she never acknowledged health risks of radiation exposure. At the time of Curie’s research, the damaging effects of ionizing radiation were unknown. It was not until the 1940’s and the Atomic Age that full effects of radiation were discovered. She was interred in Sceaux with her husband. In 1995, both their remain were transferred to the Panthéon, Paris. Curie’s papers from the 1890’s are considered too dangerous to handle due to their level radioactive contamination. The documents are housed in lead- lined boxes. Even today if one wanted to consult the documents, protective clothing must be worn. Marie’s lab books, which are still radioactive. Her notebooks cannot be handled until 3511.</SMPL>

Curie is known for overcoming the barriers placed in her way because she was a woman. Leading a moderate lifestyle: She received a scholarship in 1893, but returned it in 1897 once she was able to support herself. She donated her Nobel Prize money to others and insisted monetary gifts or awards be given to scientific institutions rather than to her. Curie intentionally did not patent the radium-isolation process so others could do research. Curie became an icon in the scientific world and her legacy as a woman pioneering the fields of physics and chemistry exists to this day. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to two Nobel Prizes, and the only woman to win in two field (Chemistry and Physics), and the only person to win in multiple sciences.</SMPL>
